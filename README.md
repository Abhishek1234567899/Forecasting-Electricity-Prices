# Forecasting Electricity Prices

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a forecasting model for electricity prices based on hourly energy demand, energy generation from various sources, and weather parameters. This model aims to provide accurate predictions to help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding energy trading and consumption.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Hourly Energy Demand**: Historical data of energy consumption per hour.
- **Energy Generation**: Contributions from various sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and fossil fuels.
- **Weather Parameters**: Relevant weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

## Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from various sources to compile a comprehensive dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that can enhance the model's predictive capabilities, such as lagged variables and moving averages.
4. **Model Selection**: Implement and compare different forecasting techniques, including:
   - Time Series Analysis
   - Regression Techniques
5. **Evaluation**: Measure model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared values.

## Results
The project achieved accurate predictions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented models. Specific performance metrics will be detailed here after completing the model evaluations.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels
